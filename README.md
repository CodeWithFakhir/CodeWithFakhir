**Hi, I’m Raja Fakhir Ayoub Khan 👋**

I’m a student currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence (BSAI)**, with a strong interest in building a career in **Python development, AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.**
Even though I haven’t uploaded repositories yet, I am consistently learning, practicing, and preparing projects that I will be publishing soon as part of my professional growth.

**💼 About Me**

I’m deeply passionate about understanding how intelligent systems work and how they can be applied to solve real-world problems. My main focus right now is on building a solid foundation in **Python**, exploring **AI algorithms**, and learning how to structure **efficient, maintainable code**.
I enjoy working on concepts step by step, understanding the reasoning behind each technique, and applying it in small experimental projects.

**🚀 What I’m Working Towards**

• Becoming a strong **Python programmer** capable of writing clean and scalable code  
• Building hands-on experience in **AI, ML,** and **data-driven applications**  
• Creating future **GitHub projects** that reflect my learning journey and technical growth  
• Exploring areas like **Neural Networks, NLP, Computer Vision**, and **automation**  

**🌱 Currently Learning**

• Core + advanced **Python programming**  
• Essential **AI/ML concepts** and model-building techniques  
• **Data handling**, **preprocessing**, and **visualization**  
• Git & GitHub workflows to publish and manage future projects  
• Fundamentals of **deep learning frameworks**  

**🎯 Long-Term Goals**

• Develop a strong portfolio of **AI/ML projects**  
• Gain expertise in modern **AI tools** and **frameworks**  
• Contribute to **open-source projects** once I build confidence    
• Grow into a professional developer with a focus on **intelligent systems**  

**📫 Connect With Me**
I’m continuously learning and improving, and I look forward to sharing my work here soon.
Feel free to follow along as I build my journey in **AI** and **Python development.**
